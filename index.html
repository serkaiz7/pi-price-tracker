    <!-- Content Section About Pi Network -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>About Pi Network</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Pi Network is a groundbreaking mobile-based cryptocurrency project launched on March 14, 2019, by Stanford University academics Nicolas Kokkalis and Chengdiao Fan. With over 55 million users—known as "Pioneers"—it aims to democratize digital currency mining, making it accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Unlike traditional mining, which relies on energy-intensive hardware, Pi’s eco-friendly approach uses a simple daily tap on its app, supported by the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) with Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) for efficiency and security.</p>

      <h3>Mining and Community</h3>
      <p>Mining Pi coins is effortless: users tap a button daily on the Pi Network app (available on Android and iOS), consuming minimal battery. This mobile-first strategy fosters inclusivity, while a unique consensus algorithm ensures scalability. The community thrives through diverse roles: Pioneers confirm presence and validate transactions, Contributors build trust graphs, Ambassadors invite new users, and Nodes run software to enhance security. Each role earns Pi rewards, driving a global network spanning nearly all countries.</p>

      <h3>Mainnet Launch and Market Dynamics</h3>
      <p>The mainnet launched on February 20, 2025, marking Pi’s transition to a fully operational blockchain, enabling broader adoption and potential exchange listings. Post-launch, Pi’s price showed volatility, surging 36% to $3.41 on Bitget within an hour, then crashing nearly 50% to $0.6629 in 24 hours due to "revenge selling" by long-term holders and market speculation. With 19 million identity-verified Pioneers and 10.14 million mainnet migrations, the project is poised for growth, though stability remains a challenge.</p>

      <h3>Planned Utilities and Future Potential</h3>
      <p>Pi Network plans to introduce real-world utilities, including an attention marketplace where users earn Pi by viewing ads, and a barter marketplace for trading goods and services. A decentralized app store will support developers, leveraging SCP’s 3-5 second block times and up to 2,000 TPS. These innovations, backed by a community of 55 million, could drive adoption, though success hinges on ecosystem development and market acceptance.</p>

      <h3>Controversies and Challenges</h3>
      <p>Despite its progress, Pi Network faces scrutiny. Critics label its referral model and past delays—postponed from December 2024 to February 2025—as potential scam indicators, comparing it to pyramid schemes due to limited transparency and no value until recent listings. The project counters with community-driven efforts, over 19 million KYC-verified users, and planned utilities, aiming to build a legitimate ecosystem.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Pi Network’s mobile-first, eco-friendly vision and massive community make it a compelling player in the cryptocurrency space. Its mainnet launch and planned utilities signal potential, but price volatility and controversies highlight risks. As it navigates these challenges, Pi remains a project to watch, with its future tied to adoption and market trust as of March 10, 2025.</p>
